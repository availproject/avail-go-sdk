# Note
This repo uses `mdbook` to generate documentation and `just` to run all the shell commands.
You can install both tools by running and executing `./install_dependencies.sh`. It should work as long as you have cargo installed.

# Release Strategy
This project uses [GitHub Flow](https://www.alexhyett.com/git-flow-github-flow/) to manage release and branches.

# Documentation
